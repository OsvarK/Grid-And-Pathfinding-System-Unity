# Grid-And-Pathfinding-System-Unity
Instead of having to remake a grid system every time I want to visualize or prototype something, I instead created a simple grid system template that can be expanded upon. The system has basic cell interaction and a drag controlled camera. The grid is mostly an invisible grid, but it has some basic rendering in form of gizmos. The project is utilizing Unity, but I have separated the grid logic to not use the Unity library to have the ability to reuse the code elsewhere. I tried to document as much as possible if there is any one coming across this.
